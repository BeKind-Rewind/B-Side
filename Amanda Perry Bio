    <h1>Student Bio</h1>

    <p>
        I am an artist, wife, daughter, mother, health and wellness professional, 
        rowing coach, gamer and a dog-mom of 3 mutts. I studied music at The Ohio State University,
        with a focus on f horn and voice. Concurrently, I was a D-1 varsity rower, while commuting,
        and maintaining a job. The workload was intense and I loved it! 
    </p>

    <br />

    <p> Hard work lead to successes I couldn't have imagined, as recently as this past year being inducted
        into The Ohio State University Athletics Hall of Fame. Surprisingly, I found many crossovers 
        from the world of visual and musical arts into the world of competitive athletics. The discipline 
        and confidence required to be the best I could be as an artist, held true in athletics, and 
        continues to hold true in my relationships and in life. I realized how much control I had over my life.
        Through this, I realized my love of seeking knowledge and passing on those discoveries to others.
